The hubble stores data in big endian, while the intel i7 stores in little endian.

From calculation, we can see that
521,821 in hex is 00 07 F6 65
2,256,461 in hex is 00 22 6E 4D, thus -2,256,461 can be represented by the twos complement, which in hex is 00 1D 91 B3

Thus the intel should store the data
521,821 as 65 F6 07 00
-2,256,461 as B3 91 1D 00
