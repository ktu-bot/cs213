The hubble stores data in big endian, while the intel i7 stores in little endian.

From calculation, we can see that
521,821 in hex is 0007F665
2,256,461 in hex is 00226E4D, thus -2,256,461 can be represented by the twos complement, which in hex is FFDD91B3

Thus the intel should store the data
521,821 as 65F60700
-2,256,461 as B391DDFF
